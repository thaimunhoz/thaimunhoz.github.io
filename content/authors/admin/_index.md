      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network‚Äôs architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I hold a bachelor‚Äôs degree in Cartography and Surveying Engineering from the University of S√£o Paulo State, Brazil, where I began exploring satellite positioning (GNSS), atmospheric modeling, and remote sensing studies. My academic journey has taken me across borders: I‚Äôve worked with research groups at the University of New Brunswick, and the National Research Council of Italy (CNR-IREA), where I applied hyperspectral sensors and machine learning algorithms to dive into inland waters remote sensing. I also earned a master‚Äôs degree in Remote Sensing from Brazil‚Äôs National Institute for Space Research (INPE), working on the calibration of bio-optical models to monitor water quality parameters using satellite observations.
Currently, I‚Äôm pursuing a PhD in Biosystems Engineering at Mississippi State University, and I'm a member of the Geospatial Computing for Environmental Research Lab (GCER). My work focuses on aquatic remote sensing, computer vision and deep learning to advance water resource management.
My research interests include remote sensing in aquatic environments, multi-sensor applications, computer vision, and deep learning modeling.
Let‚Äôs dive in and explore the work I‚Äôm passionate about!
